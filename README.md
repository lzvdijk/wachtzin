# wachtzin

## Simple pseudorandom passphrase generator in Dutch.

Wordlist originally created by: https://github.com/OpenTaal/opentaal-wordlist 

Curated down to 144336 words by removing overly long words, words containing 
special characters and potentially offensive phrases (don't judge I need to send these to customers)

## Installing and running

If you're using python>3.6, you shouldn't really have to install anything. Just pull this repo and run ```main.py```.

Poetry support is included for future development.
